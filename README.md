# Gemma-NameCraft
Do you have a new born baby and don't know how to name him/her in Chinese? Worry about wuxing or Fengshui? Looking for inspiration?

This project uses Gemma2 to assist new parents in naming their babies (in Chinese).

This project is part of Gemma Sprint 2024, an activity under the GDE program.

## What is it?

`Gemma-NameCraft` is a chatbot that assists new parents with Chinese name-giving.

Giving a name to a newborn baby in Chinese culture is important and difficult because it's believed to have a significant impact on their future. Parents often consider various beliefs, such as wuxing(五行) and bazi(八字), when choosing a name. Chinese names are typically composed of two or three characters, which can be difficult to choose and combine in a meaningful and harmonious way. Parents must also consider the stroke order and balance of the characters when selecting a name. Overall, naming a baby in Chinese culture is a complex and significant process that requires a lot of thought and consideration.

The chatbot can help new parents with these features:

1. Getting name inspiration from Chinese poetries (唐诗 or 宋词)
2. Getting name inspiration from the parents' unique experiences (a love story maybe?)
   1. Get name inspiration from images. Perhaps you have some very precious memories captured as photos, and want to use them to create unique names for your babies? We've got you covered!
3. Getting name inspiration from the parents' faith, worldview, expectation or hope for their children
4. Name evaluation:
   1. Evaluate the meaningfulness of each name
   2. Evaluate the wuxing or bazi of each name
